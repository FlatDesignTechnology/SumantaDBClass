# SumantaDBClass
You can boost your CRUD Operations using dbClass.

Example: 

1. First you need to include the class.
2. use \DBClassNamespace\DBClass; // Call the namespace for preventing naming collisons.
3. extends DBClass into your child class.
4. $this->selectResults('table_name'); // for select query.
